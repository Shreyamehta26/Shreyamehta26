## Hey there! I’m Shreya Mehta 👋  
👩🏻‍💻 Backend & AI-Curious Developer

I’m a final-year Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering student with a strong interest in **backend development, APIs, and AI-driven systems**. I enjoy building reliable applications using **Java & Spring Boot**, working with databases, and exploring how **AI tools and LLM fundamentals** fit into real-world products.

From building **Raksha Kavach** (a JavaFX & Firebase platform) to contributing to mobile app development during my internship, I like turning ideas into scalable, working solutions. Currently deep-diving into **AI fundamentals, cloud technologies, and automation**, with a strong focus on learning by building.
